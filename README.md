Prospects for measuring the di-Higgs coupling with the ATLAS detector using a MVA analysis at the HL-LHC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cross sections corresponding to di-Higgs processes are much smaller than those from single Higgs production due to the suppression induced by a heavier final state and an additional weak coupling. Even with the highest LHC centre-of-mass energy and the event statistic reached at the end of the LHC era, any meaningful extraction of the self-couplings are very challenging. However, the prospect to observe a di-Higgs production with a further determination of the triple Higgs coupling seems feasible under optimistic assumptions at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).

The most promising final state, due to the low background and acceptable branching fraction, includes a pair of b quarks and photons ($h\to\gamma\gamma b\bar{b}$) Current ATLAS cut-and-count $h\to\gamma\gamma b\bar{b}$ prospects analysis reached an expected significance for the di-Higgs production of 1.05/sigma at the HL-LHC. However, recent studies shows that the detector performance could improve, increasing the significance to 1.4\sigma. We propose to improve the sensitivity by introducing more variables that contains extra kinematic information to the fit, known as multivariate analysis (MVA).

The project is divided in two set of scripts:
* The main analysis that performs the full physics object reconstruction creating an input sample for the MVA analysis
* The tree analysis that takes the physics objects from the previous step to perform an improved MVA analysis
