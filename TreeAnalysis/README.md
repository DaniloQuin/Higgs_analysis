This set of scripts use an input file (tree file) from the Main analysis code to: classify differents MVA methods, create a branch with the selected method (with best performance) and make the full analysis selection to finally calculate the significance. Each script is explain as follows:

diHiggsbbyyTreeInput
--------------------
* Takes the input file from the main analysis code output
* Loop over the sample events, filling the same variables as the input file
* Several selection cuts are defined, after each selection the total number of events generated by the MC sample is calculated
* Finally, an output file that contains the same variables as the input, is created with the events reconstructed after a specific selection cut. The goal is to check the optimal point to make the selection cut in order to obtain a higher significance

diHiggsTMVATreeClassification
-----------------------------
* Takes the input file from diHiggsbbyyInput output
* Runs over the signal and all bkg samples at the same time
* Defines the input and spectator variables that are going to be used and not, respectively, in the MVA training. Spectator variables, which are not used in the MVA training, are going to be included in the output file
* The total number of events for each sample is divided in training and testing events. Training events are used by the MVA methods to implement the variable that discriminate signal from bkg, while testing events are use to check the validity of the discriminator
* MVA methods are defined including properties that can be varied in  order to increase their performance
* A histogram file is created with the same variables as the input, including also several variables for the MVA methods. A comparison of the performance of each MVA method can be calculated from these last set of variables, by using for example TMVAGui
* A 'xml' file that includes the weights for each MVA method is created to be used in the next step

diHiggsTMVATree
---------------
* Takes the input 'root' file from the main analysis code, and the MVA weights from the diHiggsTMVATreeClassification 'xml' file
* Defines the input and spectator variables that are included in the output 'xml' file, the variables from the input 'root' file, and the ouput variables to be created 
* Fills the output variables using the same as the input file, but this time including the MVA discriminant as one of them

diHiggsbbyyTreeAnalysis
-----------------------
* Takes the input file from diHiggsTMVATree output
* Defines the same set of variables from the input file to be filled after the appropiate selection cut
* A cut-flow of the real number of events at 3000 fb-1 (multiplying by the weight and dividing by the generated events) after each selection cut is calculated
* The selection cut for the MVA method is calculated from the TMVAGui recommendation after the selection defined in diHiggsbbyyTreeInput. This number of events is going to be used to calculate the significance 

drawHist_Preselc
----------------
* Takes the input file from diHiggsTMVATree output
* Plots all variables for each sample in the same canvas before the analysis selection cuts
